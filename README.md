# Off-by-One Error in Java Array

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The error occurs in the first loop where the loop condition incorrectly includes the index equal to the array's length, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The corrected code is provided in `BugSolution.java`.
